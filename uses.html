					to Google Glass first released to the public in 2014, augmented reality technology 
					has advanced and become more available for public use. Recent advancements and 
					innovations point to a promising future for AR tech to become more accessible in our 
					lives.<br><br>The ability to visualize 3D images as if they were real objects is 
					attracting entrepreneurs and many large technology companies (ft.com). Tim 
					Cook, Apple chief executive, has said AR would become an “everyday” experience for 
					consumers. Apple has been experimenting with headset prototypes in its labs over the 
					past year.  Several companies are taking advantage of the latest advances in image 
					processing and lower energy consumption from chipmakers such as Intel, Qualcomm and 
					Nvidia to further the development of their headsets (ft.com).<br><br>The image to the
