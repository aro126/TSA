				<p><b>APPLICATIONS:</b><br><br> Augmented Reality (AR) is used for a wide variety of purposes. 
					Everything from the yard lines on the football field when you're watching a game on television
					(Augment.com) to Google's ability to translate live images (translate.google.com) are 
					common uses of augmented reality in everyday life. Over the years, AR has become more 
					prevalent in public use. The technology that was once only available
					in college labratories and government facilities is now available on the average 
					smart phone. (Augment.com)<br><br>With widespread availability, augmented reality will
					only continue developing new uses and new technological advances. Major companies, like 
					Apple and Google, have started incorporating augmented reality into their devices 
					as well. (bgr.com) Their usage may, in the future, include identify objects and faces 
					when the camera is pointed at them and showing the user a live gps view that overlays 
					with what the camera is viewing to mark buildings and locations.
